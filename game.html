				<p>Lightning dragons (Draco electricae) are greedy, powerful beasts and are certainly much more brawny than brainy. Often called storm dragons or thunder dragons, they commonly terrorize other, smaller, species like the wind dragon as they swoop through the skies with enormous wings. Be watchful for these big bullies of the dragon world.Like the death dragons, it is not known exactly how lightning dragons originated but some speculate they somehow evolved from the offspring of an electric dragon and a chronic dragon. They arrived in Africa during the late 1700's and promptly began claiming territory, pushing other dragons from their land and forcing them to pay tribute or risk being attacked.

Eventually, the other dragons joined together and overthrew their rulers, pushing them out of Africa and into the Americas. To this day the lightning dragons reside mostly in South America but a few sometimes stalk up north to Mexico and the United States to wreak havoc.Most lightning dragons are black or dark blue in color and have an enormous wingspan. They are the third largest species of dragon after the rock dragons and chaos dragons, not to mention one of the most feared. A breath weapon of seething lightning complements their fiery tempers and aggressive personalities, along with razor-sharp claws to tear into their enemies.

Lightning dragons do not have an elected ruler but they hope to join the ranks of Catylketz one day. Catylketz, however, appears to show no interest in warriors of such low class</p>

		<p>In fantasy novels, Dark Lords have become something of a cliché stemming from the success of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, in which the main antagonist, Sauron, is often referred to as the "Dark Lord". On occasion, the people of Gondor in Middle-earth refer to Sauron as "The Enemy" or "The Nameless Enemy" despite knowing his real name; arguably starting the practice of avoiding pronouncing a Dark Lord's actual name. In fact the name Sauron, meaning the Abhorred, itself is already a mockery of his actual name given him by his enemies, with his original name being Mairon, the Admirable. He was known by this name before joining Morgoth's forces, and continued calling himself Mairon. In Tolkien's legendarium, Sauron is the second Dark Lord; he was the lieutenant of the first Dark Lord, Morgoth (also a title or epithet meaning "dark enemy"), until the latter's defeat. Morgoth's original name was Melkor (he who arises in might).[1] Following the example of Sauron, Dark Lords in fantasy are always depicted as immensely powerful and implacably evil creatures with a great desire for power. One example of a powerful Dark Lord in the world of literature is the Dark Wizard Lord Voldemort from J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels, earning his place as a Dark Lord having surpassed the magical abilities of any other dark wizard before him, thus he is considered not a Dark Wizard but the first and only Dark Lord within the Harry Potter franchise, being so powerful and evil that his enemies even dreaded to speak his name. The Dark One in Robert Jordan's the wheel of time is a powerful being always existing and trying to shape the world in the shadows image. He has more goals than this though. Dark Lords have a negative effect in their worlds, throwing them into ruin and despair.</p>

			<p>The dark night of the soul is a stage in personal development when a person undergoes a difficult and significant transition to a deeper perception of life and their place in it. This enhanced awareness is accompanied by a painful shedding of previous conceptual frameworks such as an identity, relationship, career, habit or belief system that previously allowed them to construct meaning in their life.
The Dark Night of the Soul might sound unfamiliar but it has various relative conceptions in religion, mythology and psychology. Some common associated conditions like ‘existential crisis’ and forms of depression are more recognisable. Other related concepts include ‘Positive Disintegration’ in psychology, ‘Soul Loss’ or the ‘Descent to the Underworld’ in Shamanism, ‘Katabasis’ in Greek mythology and ‘Nigredo’ as Carl Jung symbolically understood it in Alchemy. The “Dark Night of the Soul” aka “Oscura Noche” however references the name given retroactively to an untitled poem by the 16th century Roman Catholic priest and mystic; St. John of the Cross, where he describes the anguish of the separation of an individual’s soul from God while imprisoned for his unconventional religious beliefs</p>
